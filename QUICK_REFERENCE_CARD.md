## 🎯 Your 30-Second Elevator Pitch

"I'm a Quality Architect with 5+ years at Bristol Myers Squibb specializing in computer system validation. What sets me apart is my combination of deep validation expertise and modern technical skills - I build production systems in TypeScript, Python, and cloud platforms, not just validate them. At BMS, I've validated AI agents, built custom workflow automation platforms, and led SAP and cloud migrations. I enable innovation while maintaining regulatory compliance, and I'm passionate about modernizing pharmaceutical validation through approaches like CSA, DevOps integration, and risk-based strategies."

## 🔑 Key Frameworks to Reference

### ITSM Flow (When discussing incident management):
```
Incident → Problem → Deviation → CAPA
(Symptom) (Root Cause) (GxP Impact) (System Fix)
```

### GAMP 5 Categories (When discussing validation approach):
- **Cat 1**: Infrastructure (OS, database)
- **Cat 3**: COTS (standard software, no config)
- **Cat 4**: Configured (SAP, ServiceNow)
- **Cat 5**: Custom (your GxPert, automation platform)

### CSA Risk Categories (When discussing modern validation):
- **Basic**: Minimal risk, minimal documentation
- **Supplemental**: Indirect impact, moderate documentation
- **Critical**: Direct patient/quality impact, comprehensive documentation

### Cloud Shared Responsibility:
- **Vendor**: Infrastructure, physical security, hypervisor
- **You**: Application, configuration, data, access control, validation
