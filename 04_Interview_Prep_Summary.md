## 🎓 Key Concepts - Must Know

### **Test Types (Can explain differences):**
- **IQ**: Installation verification, infrastructure checks
- **OQ**: Functional testing, calculations, security
- **PQ**: Production use, end-to-end workflows
- **SIT**: Integration, API testing
- **ST**: Smoke tests, deployment verification
- **UAT**: User acceptance, usability

### **Automation Frameworks:**
- **Selenium**: Mature, widely used, good for legacy
- **Playwright**: Modern, auto-waiting, better debugging
- **Page Object Model**: UI changes in one place
- **Data-Driven**: Excel/JSON for test data

### **CI/CD for GxP:**
- Automate testing, not deployment
- Approval gates for production
- Evidence collection automatic
- Traceability matrix generated

### **21 CFR Part 11:**
- Validation of systems
- Audit trails (who, what, when, why)
- Access controls (RBAC)
- Electronic signatures

### **Metrics:**
- Pass rate: >95%
- Flaky rate: <5%
- Coverage: >80% critical code
- Execution time: Smoke <10min, Regression <2hrs

## 🗣️ Sample Interview Answers

### Q: "Tell me about yourself"

"I'm a Quality Architect with X years in pharmaceutical validation. Most recently, I led test automation efforts for [System], reducing regression time from 2 weeks to 2 hours while maintaining GxP compliance. 

I specialize in computer system validation with expertise in CSV methodologies, test automation frameworks like Selenium and Playwright, and CI/CD integration for validated systems. I'm particularly interested in this role because [specific reason about company/role]."

### Q: "What's your testing strategy?"

"I follow a risk-based approach using the test pyramid:

**Foundation (60%):** Unit tests - fast, cheap, run constantly

**Middle (30%):** Integration/API tests - verify system components work together

**Top (10%):** E2E/UI tests - critical workflows only

For GxP specifically:
- **IQ/OQ/PQ** for initial validation
- **Regression suite** automated (70-80%)
- **Smoke tests** on every deployment
- **Exploratory testing** manual (can't automate)

The goal: Maximum coverage with minimum maintenance."

### Q: "How do you handle a flaky test?"

"Systematic debugging:

1. **Reproduce**: Run 10 times locally
2. **Identify cause**: 
   - Timing? Add explicit waits
   - Data dependency? Isolate test data
   - Network? Add retry or mock
3. **Fix root cause**: Not just add sleep()
4. **Monitor**: Track flaky rate as KPI (<5% target)
5. **Quarantine if needed**: Don't let it pollute results

Recent example: [specific story about fixing a flaky test]"

### Q: "Selenium or Playwright?"

"Depends on context:

**Playwright** when:
- Modern SPA (React/Angular)
- Need auto-waiting (reduce flakiness)
- Want better debugging (trace viewer)
- Starting fresh project

**Selenium** when:
- Legacy application
- Team already expert in Selenium
- Need IE11 support
- Large existing suite (migration cost)

I've used both. Most recent project was Playwright for a cloud LIMS - auto-waiting reduced flaky tests from 15% to 2%."

### Q: "Why automate testing?"

"ROI is compelling:

**Quantitative:**
- 500 manual tests @ 10min each = 83 hours/cycle
- At $50/hr, that's $83K/year
- Automation: $40K initial + $10K/year maintenance
- Saves $33K Year 1, $73K/year after

**Qualitative:**
- Catch bugs 40% earlier (cheaper to fix)
- Test on every commit (vs just releases)
- Consistent execution (no human error)
- Free QA for exploratory testing
- Better documentation

**But** - not everything should be automated. One-time tests, UX evaluation, exploratory testing stay manual. Best approach is hybrid: automate regression, keep exploratory manual."
